# BrainFit-Android-App

This application was build on Android studio. I am not watching this code anymore so not sure if the web services are still working. This was my project from university.

 This application helps people with mini stroke to recover from the stroke which are memory problem, speaking problem, numbness(weakness) in hands, etc. with the help of games. This application also has face detection to help measure drooling of face which is also post seizure effect that the patient goes through. It also has alarm in order to remind them to take medicine or day-to-day work they have to do.
Following are my paper published if you are intersted in reading you can check out the details:
